# Frequently asked questions

## Is AiFw a fork of OPNsense or pfSense?

No. AiFw is a ground-up rewrite in Rust. It runs on FreeBSD and uses pf for packet filtering, but shares no PHP or codebase with OPNsense or pfSense. The user-space services, web UI, REST API, and CLI are all original Rust and Next.js code.

## Does AiFw require AI features to work?

No. AiFw is a complete firewall, router, DHCP server, DNS resolver, IDS/IPS, reverse proxy, and NTP server without any AI features enabled. The five behavioural detectors in `aifw-ai` (port scan, DDoS, brute force, C2 beacon, DNS tunneling) are **opt-in, experimental, and disabled by default**. They will be developed further in future releases.

## Can I import my existing OPNsense config?

Yes. AiFw ships an OPNsense XML importer that parses your config, previews a diff of what'll change, and applies atomically with rollback on failure. The importer was rewritten end-to-end in 2026 (PRs #230 and #248–#252). See the [backup &amp; migration guide]({{ '/docs/backup/#opnsense-import' | relative_url }}).

## Does AiFw support Multi-WAN failover and load balancing?

Yes. AiFw ships an enterprise-grade multi-WAN system with **FIB isolation per WAN**, gateway groups (failover, weighted, MOS-weighted adaptive), policy routing on 5-tuple + DSCP + geo-IP, and **blast-radius preview** before apply. See the [multi-WAN guide]({{ '/multi-wan/' | relative_url }}).

## What hardware do I need to run AiFw?

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 1 amd64 core | 2+ cores, AES-NI |
| RAM | 1 GB | 4 GB+ (more for IDS) |
| Disk | 4 GB | 16 GB SSD |
| NIC | 1 | 2+ (WAN + LAN) |

arm64 (Raspberry Pi, Ampere) is planned but not yet supported. AiFw runs anywhere FreeBSD runs — bare metal, KVM, Proxmox, VMware ESXi, bhyve.

## Is AiFw production-ready?

AiFw is in **active development (beta)**. The core firewall, NAT, WireGuard, IDS, DHCP, DNS, multi-WAN, and HA subsystems are implemented and run on real appliances today, but automated FreeBSD live-traffic validation is still being built out, and some surfaces — **CoDel shaping, OAuth login** — are in development without a working data plane yet. **AI threat detection is opt-in / experimental** and the **plugin system is in beta**. Check the [feature maturity matrix]({{ '/maturity/' | relative_url }}) for the per-feature state before depending on a specific feature in production.

## How do I migrate from pfSense to AiFw?

Direct pfSense XML import is not supported. The recommended path is to export your pfSense config to OPNsense first (community tooling exists), then use AiFw's [OPNsense importer]({{ '/docs/backup/#opnsense-import' | relative_url }}). Alternatively, rebuild config from scratch — the AiFw web UI is fast.

## Does AiFw have a paid version or paid tier?

No. Every feature is MIT-licensed and free. There is no paid tier, no gated features, and no telemetry or cloud dependency.

## Where can I get help?

GitHub Discussions and Issues at [https://github.com/ZerosAndOnesLLC/AiFw](https://github.com/ZerosAndOnesLLC/AiFw). The repo also includes detailed docs in `CLAUDE.md` and the `docs/` directory.

## How does AiFw compare to OPNsense and pfSense?

**AiFw wins on:** Sigma + YARA rule support, AI threat detection, commit-confirm auto-rollback, modern React UI, multi-WAN with FIB isolation, OPNsense config import, built-in reverse proxy + ACME.

**AiFw lags on:** OpenVPN, mobile/IKEv1 IPsec clients, inline IPS, LDAP/RADIUS, captive portal, DDNS WAN client, project age.

See the [full comparison]({{ '/compare/' | relative_url }}).

## Does AiFw support OpenVPN?

Not currently. AiFw supports **WireGuard** and **IKEv2 site-to-site IPsec** today. If OpenVPN specifically is a hard requirement, stay on pfSense or OPNsense.

## Can I run AiFw in a VM?

Yes. AiFw runs anywhere FreeBSD runs — bare metal, KVM, Proxmox, VMware ESXi, bhyve. AWS and DigitalOcean FreeBSD images are untested but should work.

## Does AiFw work with WireGuard mobile clients?

Yes. AiFw generates per-peer `.conf` files you can scan as a QR code from the WireGuard mobile app. Persistent keepalive can be set per peer. Handshake status is shown live in the web UI.

## How does HA failover work?

AiFw runs an active-passive pair using **CARP** (virtual IP) and **pfsync** (state-table sync), designed so TCP sessions survive a master failover and WireGuard reconnects within a few seconds when peers set `PersistentKeepalive`. Treat the timing numbers as **design targets**: automated two-node failover validation is still being built ([#534](https://github.com/ZerosAndOnesLLC/AiFw/issues/534)), so validate failover in your own environment before relying on it. See the [HA cluster guide]({{ '/ha/' | relative_url }}).

## Is the source code auditable / where do I read it?

Yes. The full source is at [github.com/ZerosAndOnesLLC/AiFw](https://github.com/ZerosAndOnesLLC/AiFw) under the MIT license. The codebase is Rust workspace crates plus a Next.js web UI. `CLAUDE.md` in the repo root has an architectural overview.
