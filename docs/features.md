# Features

A complete inventory of what AiFw ships with today. All features are MIT-licensed and included in the free download — no paid tiers, no gated features. Items marked *in development* have configuration surfaces but their data planes are still being built; the [feature maturity matrix]({{ '/maturity/' | relative_url }}) tracks the per-feature state.

## Firewall & filtering

- **Stateful packet filtering** via FreeBSD pf — scheduling, aliases, per-rule logging
- **IPv4 + IPv6** with both/dual-stack rule matching
- **Rule scheduling** — time-based activation (e.g., block social media during work hours)
- **Aliases** — named IP/port groups reusable across rules
- **VLAN support**, 802.1Q tagging
- **Static routing** with per-route metrics
- **Traffic shaping** — HFSC, PRIQ queues; CoDel (dummynet FQ-CoDel backend) *in development*
- **Rate limiting** with overload tables

## NAT

- **SNAT** (outbound source NAT)
- **DNAT / port forwarding** with reflection
- **Masquerading** (dynamic SNAT to interface address)
- **1:1 NAT** (binat)
- **NAT64** (IPv6 → IPv4) — real cross-family translation via pf `af-to`, with DNS64 synthesis in the built-in resolver
- **NAT46** (IPv4 → IPv6) — the reverse direction, a first-class rule type few firewall distros offer

## Multi-WAN

Enterprise-grade multi-WAN built on FreeBSD FIBs and pf. Designed to match what Cisco IOS PBR + IP SLA and Juniper routing-instances + RPM offer, with a few features neither has.

- **FIB isolation** — each WAN lives in its own FreeBSD FIB, the same isolation primitive as Juniper routing-instances or Cisco VRFs.
- **Active health monitoring** — ICMP, TCP, HTTP, and DNS probes with hysteresis and MOS scoring on every probe kind.
- **Gateway groups** — failover, weighted load-balance, and MOS-weighted adaptive policies.
- **Policy routing** — match on 5-tuple + interface + DSCP + geo-IP. Steer to an instance, gateway, or group.
- **Blast-radius preview** — dry-run any config change to see which existing flows would be re-routed and whether management traffic would be stranded, before applying.
- **Per-flow visibility** — live pf state table joined to policy labels, with one-click force-migrate.
- **GitOps export/import** — `GET /api/v1/multiwan/config.yaml` returns the entire multi-WAN config; POST it back to apply.
- **Anomaly scoring** (optional) — SLA baseline deviation alerting when probes still pass but the latency profile shifted.

See the [multi-WAN setup guide]({{ '/multi-wan/' | relative_url }}) for FIB bootstrap, gateway monitoring, policy construction, and the pf rules emitted under `aifw-pbr`, `aifw-mwan-reply`, and `aifw-mwan-leak`.

## VPN

### WireGuard
- Tunnel creation with automatic keypair generation
- Peer management with allowed IPs, preshared keys, persistent keepalive
- Client config (`.conf`) generation per peer
- Next-available-IP assignment
- Split or full tunnel support
- Live tunnel status and transfer counters

### IPsec
IKEv2 **site-to-site** tunnels (tunnel mode) powered by strongSwan: charon negotiates IKE and installs real kernel SAs/policies, with NAT-T, rekeying, dead-peer detection, and unattended reboot recovery. Authentication via pre-shared key or X.509 certificate (built-in ACME store or pasted PEM); live negotiated state (IKE state, child SAs, byte counters, rekey countdown) is read from charon, never a database column. Verified end-to-end between two FreeBSD endpoints — including rekey with zero packet loss — before these claims shipped ([#530](https://github.com/ZerosAndOnesLLC/AiFw/issues/530)). Deliberately not offered: IKEv1, AH, transport mode, and mobile/EAP clients (use WireGuard for road-warrior).

## IDS / IPS

- **Three modes** — Disabled, IDS (alert-only), IPS (**reactive source blocking**: after a drop-verdict detection the source IP is blocked via a pf table; the triggering packet itself is not stopped — true inline prevention is on the roadmap)
- **Rule formats** — Suricata, Sigma, YARA (practical subsets mapped to network flows — not full engine parity; Sigma rules always alert, never drop)
- **ET Open rule source integration** with auto-update
- **Alert management** — severity levels, acknowledgment, classification, analyst notes
- **Per-rule suppression** by source IP or destination IP
- **Flow tracking** with active flow counting
- **Hit count per rule** with last-hit timestamp
- **Payload inspection** with multi-pattern detection
- **Threshold-based detection**

## AI threat detection

Five behavioural detectors run alongside signature-based IDS, implemented in `aifw-ai/src/detectors/`:

1. **Port scan** — flags sources with >15 unique ports hit and >60% failed-connection ratio
2. **DDoS** — detects SYN floods and high connection rates (>50 conn/sec)
3. **Brute force** — concentrated auth attacks: 10+ connections across 1–5 ports with >70% failure rate
4. **C2 beacon** — low-variance periodic connections to single or few hosts
5. **DNS tunneling** — anomalous DNS traffic patterns consistent with tunneled data

Each detector produces a threat score (0.0–1.0 confidence) and severity classification. Auto-response actions include temporary IP blocks with configurable TTL, alert generation, and full audit trail of every decision.

## DNS

- Full recursive resolver (rDNS)
- Local host overrides (custom A/AAAA records)
- Domain overrides (custom zones)
- Access control lists
- DNSSEC validation
- Query logging
- Rebind protection, identity hiding

## DNS blocklists

- Source URL configuration with periodic auto-refresh
- Per-list hit counters and last-fetch metadata
- Allowlist override that beats blocklist rules
- Per-blocklist enable/disable, with no resolver restart required
- Compatible with common public blocklists (StevenBlack, OISD, etc.)

See the [DNS guide]({{ '/docs/dns/' | relative_url }}) for sources, refresh cadence, and allowlist examples.

## DHCP

- DHCPv4 server with multiple subnets
- Static reservations (MAC → IP)
- Active lease tracking and release
- Pool statistics
- **HA failover** with peer state sync
- **DDNS** — automatic DHCP-to-DNS updates
- Configurable lease time, gateway, DNS per subnet

## Reverse proxy &amp; ACME

Built-in TrafficCop reverse proxy — no HAProxy/Nginx package install:

- **HTTP routers** with path and host matching
- **TCP and UDP routers** with SNI matching
- **Services** with multiple backends, health checks, and load-balancing strategies
- **Middleware chains** — auth, rate limit, header rewrites, redirect, IP allowlist
- **TLS termination** with per-router certificate selection
- **ACME / Let's Encrypt automation** — issue, renew, and push certs to the local TLS store, a filesystem location, or a webhook destination

See the [reverse proxy guide]({{ '/docs/reverse-proxy/' | relative_url }}) for setup, ACME providers, middleware reference, and example configs.

## High availability

- **CARP** virtual IPs with VHID, advskew, advbase tuning
- **pfsync** state table synchronization
- **Cluster node management** with health checks
- Config sync between nodes

## Geo-IP

- Country-based blocking/allowing (ISO 3166 alpha-2)
- Geo-IP lookup
- Per-rule enable/disable
- Multiple country rules with action override

## Certificate Authority

- Built-in CA generation
- Certificate issuance with subject, SANs, validity
- PEM export (cert + key)
- Certificate revocation with CRL
- PKCS#12 bundle generation

## Authentication

- **Local users** with bcrypt password hashing
- **TOTP 2FA** with recovery codes
- **OAuth / SSO** — *in development*: provider configuration (Google, GitHub, generic OIDC) and the authorize flow exist, but the token exchange is not finished yet ([#170](https://github.com/ZerosAndOnesLLC/AiFw/issues/170)), so OAuth login cannot complete. See the [auth &amp; RBAC guide]({{ '/docs/auth/' | relative_url }}) for local users, the 37-permission RBAC matrix, and TOTP / API-key flows.
- **API keys** for programmatic access
- **JWT token sessions** with refresh tokens

## Authorization — RBAC

37 granular permissions including:

`dashboard:view` · `rules:read/write` · `nat:read/write` · `vpn:read/write` · `geoip:read/write` · `ids:read/write` · `dns:read/write` · `dhcp:read/write` · `aliases:read/write` · `interfaces:read/write` · `connections:view` · `logs:view` · `users:read/write` · `settings:read/write` · `plugins:read/write` · `updates:read/install` · `backup:read/write` · `system:reboot` · `proxy:read/write`

Built-in roles: **admin**, **operator**, **viewer**. Custom roles supported.

## Backup &amp; migration

- **JSON backup / restore** — entire config in one file; restore is strict (fails rather than partially applying) with automatic snapshot rollback
- **S3 backup destination** — configurable bucket and prefix; rotation policy
- **OPNsense XML import** — parse the XML, preview a diff of what'll change, apply with automatic snapshot rollback on failure
- **Versioned config history** — every change is snapshotted; diff and selective restore from the UI
- **Commit confirm** — every apply auto-reverts on timeout unless explicitly confirmed; default 300-second window

See the [backup &amp; migration guide]({{ '/docs/backup/' | relative_url }}) for the full migration workflow from OPNsense, S3 setup, and rollback procedures.
