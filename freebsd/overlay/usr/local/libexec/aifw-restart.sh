# aifw-restart.sh — detached service-restart driver.
#
# Spawned via `daemon -f` from aifw-api after install/rollback. The previous
# implementation ran an in-process tokio loop inside aifw-api, so when the
# loop reached `service aifw_api restart` the rc.d stop killed aifw-api and
# took the loop with it — recoverable failures during the start half had no
# driver left to retry. This script lives in its own session, parented to
# init, so it outlives aifw-api dying mid-iteration.
#
# Idempotent. Safe to invoke even when there's nothing to bounce.

# --- sudoers self-heal (in-place upgrade gap) ------------------------------
# In-place tarball upgrades install new binaries and the narrow aifw-sudo-*
# helpers, but the updater runs as the aifw uid and by design (SEC-C1) cannot
# write /usr/local/etc/sudoers.d/aifw. This driver runs as root via the
# `daemon -f` grant, so it is the correct privileged step to refresh the
# sudoers file from the canonical, CI-tested definition baked into the signed
# aifw-setup binary. Without this, an upgraded box keeps a stale sudoers that
# lacks the helper grants the new code calls (e.g. aifw-sudo-service), and
# operations like the DNS resolver apply/probe fail with
# "sudo: a password is required". Idempotent and validated. Runs before the
# service bounce so the restarted services come up with correct grants.
